It sounds like you're working on developing a project management system with task assignment, time tracking, task review, and communication features. Here's a breakdown of the key components you might want to consider when designing and building your system:

1. **User Accounts:**
   - Users should be able to create accounts and log in.
   - Implement user roles and permissions, such as admin, manager, and regular user.

2. **Dashboard:**
   - Users should have a personalized dashboard displaying their tasks and assignments.
   - Tasks can be categorized and prioritized.

3. **Task Management:**
   - Users can create tasks and assign them to themselves or other team members.
   - Include task details like name, description, due date, priority, and status.

4. **Time Tracking:**
   - Allow users to track the time spent on each task.
   - You can use a timer or manual entry for time tracking.

5. **Task Review:**
   - Tasks can be submitted for review, either to a manager or a designated reviewer.
   - Reviewers can provide feedback and mark tasks as approved or in need of revisions.

6. **Approval Workflow:**
   - Tasks can go through an approval workflow.
   - Depending on the workflow, tasks can be approved by one or more reviewers or managers.

7. **Communication and Collaboration:**
   - Implement a messaging system to allow users to communicate with each other.
   - You could integrate chat or messaging features.

8. **File Sharing:**
   - Allow users to upload and share files related to tasks.

9. **Notifications:**
   - Send notifications to users for task assignments, updates, and reviews.

10. **Reporting and Analytics:**
    - Provide reporting features to help users and managers track project progress and time usage.

11. **Search and Filters:**
    - Implement search and filter options for users to quickly find tasks and projects.

12. **Security:**
    - Ensure data security and access control, especially for sensitive project information.

13. **Mobile-Friendly Interface:**
    - Consider creating a responsive design for mobile access.

14. **Scalability:**
    - Design your system to be scalable as more users and tasks are added.

15. **Feedback Mechanism:**
    - Allow users to provide feedback on the system's functionality and usability for continuous improvement.

16. **Integration:**
    - Consider integration with other tools or platforms that your users might use, such as email, calendars, or version control systems.

17. **Data Backup and Recovery:**
    - Implement regular data backups and a recovery system in case of data loss.

18. **User Training and Support:**
    - Provide training materials and support for users to understand and use the system effectively.

19. **Testing and Quality Assurance:**
    - Thoroughly test the system for bugs and issues before deploying it.

20. **Feedback Loops:**
    - Continuously gather feedback from users and iterate on the system to improve it.

Building such a system is a complex task, and you may need a team of developers, designers, and project managers to bring it to fruition. Additionally, the choice of technologies and development tools will play a crucial role in the success of your project.
