  <h3 class="fw-semibold">Programming Journey</h3>
  <p>
    It all began in 2015 when I was just playing GTA Vice City ‚Äî a modded version called <em>GTA Dhaka City</em>. 
    After completing the game, I thought, "Why not create my own game?" That curiosity pushed me to search on Google and YouTube, 
    but I couldn‚Äôt find the perfect solution at that time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Eventually, I discovered <strong>Unity</strong>, a game engine. To use Unity, I had to learn C#, so I started learning from the <strong>Brackeys</strong> YouTube channel. 
    Back then, we had no ChatGPT ‚Äî I used to write code line by line with passion, curiosity, and without shortcuts.
  </p>
  <p>
    That‚Äôs also when I started learning HTML. At first, I didn't know CSS or JavaScript, but it was a magical time ‚Äî the beginning of a lifelong journey in programming.
  </p>
  <p>
    After that, I slowly shifted from game development to web development. I was curious ‚Äî how could I make my own website accessible from someone else's computer? 
    Back then, I had no idea how hosting or domains worked, and couldn‚Äôt figure it out.
  </p>
  <p>
    Around that time, I also started learning Python. Most tech YouTube channels I watched back then, especially those focused on hacking or cyber topics, 
    said that Python was the most-used language for hackers ‚Äî and that made me even more interested in it.
  </p>
  <p>
    I began learning Python from <strong>CodeWithHarry</strong>, but I felt like it didn‚Äôt quite fit my learning style. So I moved on to the <strong>freeCodeCamp</strong> 
    YouTube channel ‚Äî and that felt much more aligned with how I wanted to learn.
  </p>
  <p>
  One interesting part of my journey is that I learned how to build GUI applications and even server-based programs. 
  But the funny thing is ‚Äî I only learned about threading and multi-threading after I had already created some GUI apps! 
  I used to wonder, "How did my applications not crash without using proper threading?" üòÖ 
  Back then, the only way to find answers was Google ‚Äî and a lot of trial and error!
</p>
<p>
  Between 2015 and 2019, I was doing all these things just for fun ‚Äî not in any professional way. 
  Honestly, I didn‚Äôt even know that it could be done in a professional way! 
  That changed when I saw someone I knew writing code in Visual Studio Code. 
  I got curious, logged into VS Code myself, and after talking with her, I discovered <strong>Upwork</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  Before that, I had tried many random things ‚Äî like using Godot, Website2APK, ConcuSt, and other tools ‚Äî 
  but I had no clear direction, no real workflow, and no consistency. It was all just exploration and experiments.
</p>
<p><strong>2019</strong></p>
<p>
  This was the year I created my first account on <strong>Upwork</strong> and figured out how the freelancing system works. 
  I got my first job ‚Äî a <em>Unity game project</em> ‚Äî and from that point, I dedicated most of my time to Unity and Python projects.
</p>
<p>
  Toward the end of December, I met <strong>Shadat</strong>, who had started developing Android applications. 
  He told me more about it ‚Äî and honestly, I didn‚Äôt know a single thing about Android Studio back then.
</p>
<p>
  Yes, I had installed Android Studio once before, but only for Unity ‚Äî just to deal with those SDK issues. 
  After that conversation, I thought, "Why not try Android development too?" I already knew Python, and had written a bit of Java code.
</p>
<p>
  That‚Äôs when I discovered XML-based UI in Android. These days, most developers use Kotlin, but for me, Java felt perfect at the time.
</p>
<p>
  The period from <strong>2019 to 2021</strong> was my true learning phase. During this time, I explored a lot ‚Äî from working with <strong>OpenCV</strong> and training AI models to learning languages like <strong>PHP</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. I was expanding my skills in every direction.
</p>
<p>
  But the Python script I remember most from that time was one I wrote for brute-forcing Facebook passwords. It could check if the password matched or not ‚Äî just as an experiment. 
  What made it even more interesting was that I built it completely without internet access. I had downloaded the Facebook login and homepage HTML files from Shadat‚Äôs computer, and worked offline from there.
</p>
<p>
  That was the moment I realized ‚Äî <strong>Python is the language I feel most comfortable with</strong>. I truly understood its power, even without full-time internet access.
</p>
<p>
  Around that time, I also stopped watching tutorial videos. I transitioned into learning directly from documentation ‚Äî and that‚Äôs still how I learn today.
</p>
<p>
  After that, the time between <strong>2019 and 2025</strong> became my true working phase ‚Äî the years when I was fully involved in building real-world projects, learning deeply, and applying everything I had explored before.
</p>
<p>
  Now, as 2025 approaches, I‚Äôve been thinking about putting an end to my programming journey ‚Äî at least professionally ‚Äî because of my current path in education. 
  I‚Äôm studying <strong>BBA (Bachelor of Business Administration)</strong>, which is very different from what I‚Äôve been doing in the tech world.
